# Staking your $CRV

Starting on the 19th of September 2020, **50% of all trading fees are distributed to veCRV holders**. This is the result of a community-led proposal to align incentives between liquidity providers and governance participants (veCRV holders).

Collected fees will be used to buy 3CRV (LP token for 3Pool) and distribute them to veCRV holders. This currently represents over $15M in trading fees per year. veCRV stands for vote escrowed $CRV, they are $CRV vote locked in the Curve DAO.

You can also lock $CRV to obtain a boost on your provided liquidity.

Enter the amount you want to lock and select your expiry. Remember locking is not reversible. The amount of veCRV received will depend on how much and how long you vote for.

You can extend a lock and add $CRV to it at any point but you cannot have $CRV with different expiry dates.
