<h1>Community Fund & Treasury</h1>

## **Community Fund**

The initial distribution of CRV allocated around 151M CRV to a community fund, intended for use in emergencies or as rewards for community-led initiatives.

As of May, 2025 around 24M CRV tokens remain unallocated.

The Curve DAO has full access to these funds and can decide to award part of this fund through a proposal. Funds can only be distributed through linear vesting over a minimum duration of one year using a vesting contract.

The contract is deployed on Ethereum at [`0xe3997288987e6297ad550a69b31439504f513267`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3997288987e6297ad550a69b31439504f513267).

If you have a project you believe deserves a grant, please create a proposal on the [Governance Forum](https://gov.curve.finance/) or discuss it with a team member on [:simple-discord: Discord](https://discord.gg/twUngQYz85) or [:simple-telegram: Telegram](https://t.me/curvefi).

## **Treasury**

On June 27, 2025, the Curve DAO voted to establish a dedicated Treasury, allocating **10% of DAO revenue** to it. These funds belong to the DAO and remain entirely under its control. With a successful governance vote, they can be used for any purpose the DAO chooses, such as development, research, risk assessment, bad debt insurance, bug bounties, audits, or anything else the DAO deems appropriate. Check the governance forum post [here](https://gov.curve.finance/t/activate-the-fee-allocator-and-redirect-10-of-revenue-to-community-fund/10676).

In comparison to the community fund, assets do not require a one-year vesting period, which makes the usage of these funds much more convenient.

The Treasury is deployed on Ethereum at [`0x6508ef65b0bd57eabd0f1d52685a70433b2d290b`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6508ef65b0bd57eabd0f1d52685a70433b2d290b).
