<h1>Community Fund</h1>

The initial distribution of CRV allocated around 151M CRV to a community fund, intended for use in emergencies or as rewards for community-led initiatives. 

The Curve DAO has full access to these funds and can decide to award part of this fund through a proposal. Funds can only be distributed through linear vesting over a minimum duration of one year using a vesting contract.

The contract is deployed on Ethereum at [`0xe3997288987e6297ad550a69b31439504f513267`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3997288987e6297ad550a69b31439504f513267).

If you have a project you believe deserves a grant, please create a proposal or discuss it with a team member on [:simple-discord: Discord](https://discord.gg/twUngQYz85) or [:simple-telegram: Telegram](https://t.me/curvefi).
