<h1>Locking CRV</h1>

[Lock CRV into veCRV here](https://curve.fi/dao/ethereum/vecrv/create/)

To participate in governance votes on Curve, users need to [lock their CRV tokens](../vecrv/locking-your-crv.md) to obtain **veCRV (vote-escrowed CRV)**. Locking CRV provides four key benefits:

* Voting rights on all DAO proposals.
* Directing where weekly CRV emissions flow (Gauge Votes).
* Increased personal liquidity mining rewards (Boost).
* Earning a share of DAO revenue.

There is **no minimum veCRV** required to vote, but to **create new proposals**, users need at least **2,500 veCRV**.

### **veCRV Decay**

When you lock CRV tokens, you receive veCRV proportional to how long you lock for:

![veCRV Decay](../images/gov/vecrv-decay-dark.png#only-dark){ .centered }

* **4 years remaining:** 1 CRV = 1 veCRV
* **2 years remaining:** 1 CRV = 0.5 veCRV
* **1 year remaining:** 1 CRV = 0.25 veCRV
* **Unlocked CRV:** 0 veCRV

Your voting power **gradually decreases over time**, reaching zero at the unlock date. You can extend your lock duration at any time, which will increase your veCRV balance again.
