<h1>Gauges</h1>

[View the Gauges or Gauge Vote here](https://curve.fi/dao/ethereum/gauges/)

CRV emissions and other incentives are distributed to liquidity providers through Gauges.

When users stake their LP tokens in a gauge, they receive rewards—mostly in CRV—based on how much the gauge is allocated each week.

Each week, veCRV holders vote on how the weekly CRV emissions are distributed across all gauges.  The more votes a gauge receives, the higher its "relative weight," which determines its share of that week's CRV emissions.  These relative weights are shown on the user interface:

![Gauge Relative Weights](../images/gov/gauge-relative-weight-dark.png#only-dark){ .centered }

Below the chart is a table listing each gauge. Users can click on a gauge to view analytics like past relative weights, how much CRV it's receiving this week, and other details.

## **Gauge Voting**

Users with veCRV can vote on how CRV emissions are allocated.  All gauge votes happen on Ethereum.

You can vote for one or more gauges **at any time**, and your vote stays active until you change it.  
Each week, at **Thursday 00:00 UTC**, Curve updates the gauge weights based on all active votes.

If you don’t update your vote, your veCRV will continue to support the same gauges in future weeks.
