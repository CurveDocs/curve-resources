The native "Crypto Wallets" app in your Brave browser can often interfere with your web3 provider. When using Metamask, it is important to make sure Brave is pointing to it and not its native implementation.

## **Pointing Brave to Metamask**

Open your web browser, and paste the following in your URL bar: _brave://settings/extensions_

![Disable Wallet Brave](../images/disable-crypto-wallet-brave.webp)

Click the dropdown and switch to Metamask. You can also disable Crypto Wallets on startup.
